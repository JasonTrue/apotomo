h2. 1.0.5

h3. Bugfixes
  * Caching states works, again. Thanks to Gudleik Rasch for spotting.
  * We cleanly require cells-3.4.x now. Thanks to Ryan Bates who remarked that Apotomo 1.0.x tries to require cells-3.5, which was wrong.
  
h3. Notes
  * Removed the usage of state-args. If you want the event instance in your triggered state, use @opts[:event] or upgrade to apotomo-1.1.
  
h2. 1.0.3

h3. Bugfixes
  * fixed gemspec to not require useless gem dependencies.


h2. 1.0.2

h3. Changes
  * removals from ViewHelper: #trigger_event, #form_to_event and friends as they use deprecated Rails helpers.
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * Widget#fire now accepts payload data for the fired event.
  * triggered states now receive the event object if they expect one argument.
